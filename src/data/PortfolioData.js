      "This is a calculator for the nSuns workout program. It calculates your training max and one rep max interchangeably and automatically updates your lift values accordingly. Each box by default can be marked by clicking. Optionally, you can enable a 'rest timer' mode which turns each box into a rest timer on click. This app is also fully mobile responsive to make it available in the gym. Various presets of accessory work are available along with the option to create your own accessory plan. The website is fully functional with current plans to implement the (much more complicated) CAP3 variation of the program. This webapp uses React/Redux and Styled Components for the front end with Node and SQL for the backend. The app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to persist user authorization. Tests are written with Jest/Enzyme",
